      STEP_3_TITLE: 'Energy Mining',
      STEP_3_TEXT: 'Using this device, you can mine NTC (NetCharge) energy every 24 hours. Collect energy daily to fully charge your batteries in the ore processing device. Charging the battery increases the amount of unrefined ore that can be processed, thereby boosting your overall yield.',

      STEP_4_TITLE: 'Access Key and Tiers',
      STEP_4_TEXT: 'By activating the tier access key, you gain access to the tier to participate in launching quantum waves, followed by ore processing and Bitforce mining. Upon activation and access extension, you also receive a chip automatically installed in the quantum wave launch device. After the quantum wave launch, you can process the ore mined in that quantum wave.' +

          'At the top of the screen, you can monitor the status of the current quantum wave launch. Below is a section with a cross-sectional plan of the mine, indicating the depth of the tiers and displaying your active tier accesses.',

          'When selecting multiple activations or extensions, the first received chip for this tier will be installed in the machine to launch the current quantum wave. The second chip will be used for the quantum wave launch 30 days after the wave is launched with the first chip. The third chip will be activated 30 days after the wave is launched with the second chip, and so on.',

      STEP_13_TEXT: 'Let’s take a closer look at how the ore processing machine works.' +
          '\n\n' +
          'Starting from the beginning: A quantum wave will be initiated when 88 devices are activated. This wave will extract raw ore. The chips involved in launching the wave will determine the potential maximum amount of ore you can process in this device over 30 days. After these 30 days, you will have the opportunity to collect quantum ore.' +
          '\n\n' +
          'To process the ore, you need to keep your batteries charged. By default, you have one battery, but soon you will have the option to purchase an additional battery. Therefore, if you fully participate in the ore processing, you will obtain the maximum possible amount of quantum ore. However, if you do not participate in the ore processing, you will not receive anything.',

      STEP_14_TITLE: 'Charging the battery',
      STEP_14_TEXT: 'Here, you can see how much quantum ore you can potentially obtain after processing the ore, as well as how much time is left for processing. To charge the battery, press the upgrade button.',
